    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>The Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF) is a nonprofit organization with the mission to advance molecular sciences by building high quality, open source software and sustainable communities for research software development. Openness is our core value, whether this is related to software, science or organization management.</p>
<p>The OMSF Privacy Policy is based on the <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/privacy.html">Apache Software Foundation Privacy Policy</a> and adapted to our specific needs. We understand the importance of data security and privacy, but we also acknowledge that satisfying all legal requirements from different countries and regions with respect to these important categories can be challenging. We will continue to update this Privacy Policy as we develop a better understanding of these requirements and our usage of collected data.</p>
<p>Please assume that everything you contribute intentionally to OMSF, or to any Hosted Project under the OMSF umbrella, is public. This includes emails on public lists, wikis, online discussions of all sorts, and software or documentation that you post to this website or our revision control repositories used by OMSF or associated projects.</p>
<p>Because we follow an academic model that expects mutual personal respect, disclosure of interests and openness of expression is public information. There may be cases where you are invited to share private information for various purposes, and denote that information as such. In those cases, we commit to only disclosing that information without your permission upon receipt of a valid subpoena and following notice from OMSF to you.</p>
<p>Although what you disclose here is public, we are all limited by copyright and patent law in how we may use your contributions. Therefore, OMSF only accepts voluntary contributions of software and documentation that are expressly licensed to OMSF under an approved open source license.</p>
<p>If any of our Hosted Projects , the OMSF Foundation policy requires them to post their own privacy policy making clear those differences.</p>
