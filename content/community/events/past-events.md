### OMSF Symposium 2024: Keynotes and Pictures

Two months ago, we hosted the OMSF Symposium 2024 in Leiden. It was fantastic to see our community gathered under one roof - an unforgettable experience!

If you missed the event this year or want to revisit it, we now have photos and videos available! The symposium featured a blend of keynote presentations, partner presentations, engaging panel discussions, and hands-on project demos from leading initiatives like Open Force Field, Open Free Energy, and OpenFold.
