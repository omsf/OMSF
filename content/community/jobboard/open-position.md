**About OMSF**

The Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF) is a US-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization focused on facilitating collaboration and software development for molecular sciences. OMSF aims to create a cost-effective organization to support an ecosystem of open source projects in molecular sciences, build expertise around managing and governing these projects, explore pathways to sustainability, and accelerate innovation by sharing our knowledge and tools under open licenses.

All OMSF positions are currently remote and we generally accept applications worldwide, provided that the OMSF will be able to enter in an appropriate working agreement with the applicant in their designated country of residence. Some positions may be restricted to the US so please make sure to read the full job description before applying. Please note that you will need to have a valid work permit, as OMSF has a limited ability to sponsor any relocation visas at this stage. Please reach out to discuss visa options, if needed. Depending on your location, you might occasionally need to participate in meetings outside of normal business hours due to time zone differences.

When applying, please use the application forms linked below. Please reach out to careers@omsf.io if you have any additional questions or need help.


## OpenADMET: Science Lead - Machine Learning Models

  The Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF) is seeking a Science Lead for the OpenADMET project (OpenADMET.org), specializing in Machine Learning Models and Active Learning Strategies.
  The Science Lead will be responsible for overseeing the selection, implementation, and refinement of machine learning models and active learning strategies to drive the development of open source ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) models built from both public datasets and newly generated open ADMET datasets generated by the collaborative OpenADMET project.
  This position supervises and collaborates with scientific roles on the OMSF OpenADMET team, collaborates closely with the OpenADMET technical team to aid the development of robust training and inference infrastructure, and provides domain expertise for optimizing machine learning model development and deployment.
  This role is also instrumental in recruiting and liaising with a Technical Advisory Committee consisting of experts from academia and industry to advise on model strategies that maximize the utility of new open ADMET data generated by the project.
  The Science Lead will work remotely in collaboration with diverse teams, primarily based in Europe, Australia, and the United States, and may require occasional travel.
  
  This fully remote, grant-funded position has a minimum duration of 2 years, with potential for extension based on available funding.
  The Science Lead will report directly to the OpenADMET Project Director.

## OpenADMET: Senior Scientist - Data Curation

  The Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF) is seeking a Senior Scientist specializing in Data Curation and Pipeline Integration for the OpenADMET project (OpenADMET.org).
  This role focuses on ensuring the accuracy, quality, and accessibility of ADMET data used for machine learning applications, while developing and optimizing data workflows for seamless data ingestion, processing, and dissemination.
  The Senior Scientist will collaborate with experimental scientists at Octant/UCSF and the OpenADMET team to establish best practices for data curation and workflow integration.
  This includes preparing data in machine learning ready formats and managing data deposition into FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) repositories and ensuring the quality and reliability of all ADMET dataset classes.

  This fully remote, grant-funded position has a minimum duration of 2 years, with potential for extension depending on available funding. Due to time zone differences, occasional meetings outside standard business hours may be necessary.
  Our teams are primarily based in Europe, Australia, and the United States, and some travel may occasionally be required.
  The Senior Scientist – Data Curation and Pipeline Integration will report directly to the OpenADMET project lead, while closely collaborating with the OpenADMET ML Infrastructure team, project stakeholders, and external partners.
  This role is ideal for a resourceful individual eager to shape data-driven projects that advance ADMET research in a collaborative, open-source environment.
