Open Rosetta is a project aimed at transitioning the Rosetta Commons, a global community of over 100 labs, to an open source model. Rosetta Commons has been at the forefront of protein and RNA modeling and design for over two decades - The Rosetta software suite, renowned for its versatility in modeling a wide range of biomolecules and molecular interactions, is currently available under a custom license for non-commercial use through the University of Washington. 

The overarching goal of Rosetta Commons is to continue advancing state-of-the-art tools in macromolecular modeling and design, particularly by incorporating deep learning technology. The move to an open source model aligns with the community's values and is seen as the most efficient way to harness the power of the Rosetta software suite. This collaborative approach involves academia, government labs, research centers, and corporate partners, aiming to tackle the newest challenges in biomolecular modeling.

This change is not without challenges. It involves a thorough reexamination and adaptation of the organizational structure of Rosetta Commons. This initiative aims to lay the groundwork for a new funding model, establish a technical roadmap, and create a structure that invites contributions from scientists at all career stages across various employment sectors. This transformation is designed to honor the community's technical achievements, commitment to education and diversity, and its culture of collaborative innovation, embodying Rosettaâ€™s principle of working "better together."
