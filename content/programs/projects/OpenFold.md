## Open Fold

OpenFold is a non-profit AI research and development consortium dedicated to democratizing access to the most advanced AI systems, capable of engineering life's molecules, for a diverse array of users including academics, biotech and pharmaceutical companies, and students. These tools are designed to accelerate fundamental biological research and facilitate the development of new cures, previously unimaginable without the aid of AI.

Central to OpenFold's vision is the recognition of the vital link between structure and function in biology. Understanding the intricacies of biological systems, their engineering, and how to influence them is deeply intertwined with knowledge of their structure. To this end, OpenFoldâ€™s AI-based protein modeling tools are built to predict molecular structures with atomic accuracy, a feat that is being made accessible in open source for the first time. This advancement is envisaged as a "predictive molecular microscope," which researchers worldwide can use, enhance, and contribute to, thereby propelling further discoveries and innovations.

Additionally, OpenFold is focused on optimizing the performance of their model for use on state-of-the-art, widely available GPUs. This hopes to not only foster an environment of collaboration and open-source development, but also ensure that the benefits of these advanced AI tools remain accessible to a broad range of users, catalyzing advancements in biology and drug discovery.
