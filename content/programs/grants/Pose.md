The NSF POSE Phase II project, awarded to OMSF in September 2023, focuses on enhancing the open-source ecosystem in molecular sciences through strategic collaboration and technological innovation. It aims to leverage the expertise of OMSF’s in-house software engineers to build a shared infrastructure across OMSF’s hosted projects. These contributions are expected to advance the development of programs and foster a collaborative environment for scientific software development, aligning with the project's goals to bolster molecular modeling and open science practices.
