## Our mission
* Advance of the molecular sciences through the development of high-quality, open-source software. 
* Foster the growth of sustainable communities dedicated to research software development. 
* Bridge industry and academia to facilitate collaboration, building a hub of experts in molecular sciences.

We stand for the creation, iteration, and proliferation of high quality open molecular software. Welcome!

**Accelerate scientific, technical, and commercial progress** through rapid dissemination of knowledge and research tools in computational molecular sciences, following open science principles.

**Improve modeling accuracy, quality and the overall user** experience through more rigorous and sustainable research software development practices and continuous method validation.

**Improve sustainability and reduce software development costs** across industry and academia by pooling resources, eliminating duplication of efforts, sharing know-how and allowing reuse of software components through open licenses.

**Remove or reduce barriers to collaboration** between industry and academia by providing a clear legal and organizational framework, while making all collaboration materials and results available to the general public.

**Create a hub of experts in molecular sciences** committed to improving research software development and application practices by connecting all interested stakeholders -- researchers, developers and funders -- and providing organizational support

Our unique position allows us to put your project at the intersection of academia and industry, giving you the best of both. Our lean approach allows you to maximize your project’s impact while building from a community of respect and inclusion. Take a look at our current programs - we are proud of their continued success!

As a fiscal sponsor, we provide necessary operational support. As a community, we host a vibrant ecosystem. We strive to be a place where research software engineers, students, and industry professionals can have their work recognized and voices heard.
