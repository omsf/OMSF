**About OMSF**

The Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF) is a US-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization focused on facilitating collaboration and software development for molecular sciences. OMSF aims to create a cost-effective organization to support an ecosystem of open source projects in molecular sciences, build expertise around managing and governing these projects, explore pathways to sustainability, and accelerate innovation by sharing our knowledge and tools under open licenses.

All OMSF positions are currently remote and we generally accept applications worldwide, provided that the OMSF will be able to enter in an appropriate working agreement with the applicant in their designated country of residence. Some positions may be restricted to the US so please make sure to read the full job description before applying. Please note that you will need to have a valid work permit, as OMSF has a limited ability to sponsor any relocation visas at this stage. Please reach out to discuss visa options, if needed. Depending on your location, you might occasionally need to participate in meetings outside of normal business hours due to time zone differences.

When applying, please use the application forms linked below. Please reach out to careers@omsf.io if you have any additional questions or need help.
