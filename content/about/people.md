_University of California, Irvine_

Prof. David Mobley currently holds a joint appointment in the Pharmaceutical Sciences and Department of Chemistry at UCI. A major focus of his research is the binding of small-molecule ligands to proteins, including development, application and validation of binding free energy methods. He&#39;s currently spearheading the [SAMPL challenges](https://www.samplchallenges.org/) and co-leading the [Open Force Field Initiative](http://openforcefield.org/). He also serves on the editorial boards of the Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design and the Journal of Molecular Recognition, on the scientific advisory board for OpenEye Scientific Software, as a founding and managing editor for the [Living Journal of Computational Molecular Science](http://livecomsjournal.org/), and as an Open Science Fellow for Silicon Therapeutics.

_University of California, San Diego_

Mike Gilson, MD, PhD, is Professor and Chair in Computer-Aided Drug Design at the [Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences](https://pharmacy.ucsd.edu/) and co-director of [UC San Diego&#39;](https://ucsd.edu/)s [Center for Drug Discovery Innovation](http://drugdiscovery.ucsd.edu/). He is also a member of the Executive Committee of the [UC Drug Discovery Consortium](https://www.ucdrugdiscovery.org/). A central theme of his research groups is advancing the technologies of computer-aided drug design (CADD),  including protein-ligand binding thermodynamics, and force field development and validation. He founded [BindingDB](http://www.bindingdb.org/bind/index.jsp), a public, web-accessible medicinal chemistry database, and co-directed the [Drug Design Data Resource](https://drugdesigndata.org/) (D3R), which aimed to advance the technology of computer-aided drug discovery through the interchange of high quality protein-ligand datasets and workflows, and by holding community-wide, blinded prediction challenges. Mike is also one of the PIs leading the [Open Force Field Initiative](http://openforcefield.org/). He serves on Editorial Advisory Boards of several journals and has a long history of contributing to molecular sciences.

_Open Molecular Software Foundation_

Karmen Condic-Jurkic is the Treasurer and Secretary of the Open Molecular Software Foundation. Karmen holds a PhD in computational chemistry and has experience with a range of techniques based on quantum chemistry and classical mechanics. During her postdoc, she got interested in open science, research infrastructure and knowledge management. She attempted to build a cloud-based [repository](http://web.archive.org/web/20190228174834/http:/www.mdbox.org/) for molecular dynamics trajectories and got involved in a number of projects working on research infrastructure and data sharing. She joined the [Open Force Field Initiative](http://openforcefield.org/) in 2019 as a project manager.
