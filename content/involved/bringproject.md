Embarking on a journey with OMSF as a Hosted Project opens opportunities for growth, collaboration, and innovation. Whether you're seeking a nurturing environment for a new initiative or a stable organizational home for an existing project, OMSF is committed to providing comprehensive fiscal sponsorship and support tailored to your unique needs. Here's how to get your project off the ground and into the thriving ecosystem of OMSF.

## Getting Started with OMSF
To begin, it's crucial to clearly outline your project's vision, needs, and how you plan to utilize support and funding effectively. OMSF is here to ensure that your project's financial resources are managed with integrity, aligning with both your governance charter and OMSF’s bylaws. Engaging with OMSF not only enhances your project's visibility and network but also extends membership benefits to your financial contributors, fostering a growing community of invested stakeholders. If you’d like to learn more about these benefits, please reach out to info@omsf.io and we’d be happy to tell you more.

## Structuring Your Proposal
When preparing your project for submission, remember that clarity and detail are key to a successful application. Start by thinking about a comprehensive Project Overview, making sure to include the project's name and a detailed description. This snapshot gives OMSF and potential contributors a clear understanding of what your project is about and its core identity.

## Governance and Structure
Elaborate on your project's Governance and Structure. Include your Code of Conduct, governance documents, and information about the leadership body to demonstrate your project's commitment to ethical practices and structured leadership. If you need insight into what has worked previously, contact us at [info@omsf.io](mailto:info@omsf.io) and we can provide some guidance.

## Fiscal and Strategic Alignment
How might your project align with OMSF’s mission and values? We’d like to know how you plan to work alongside other projects and how your financial strategies align with OMSF’s guidelines.

## Planning and Development
We will need to know your project's goals. What kind of milestones are you looking to achieve? What is the proposed timetable? And how would you achieve funding for your project? Having a powerful value proposition will make getting your project at OMSF off the ground. If you’d like some guidance, please reach out to [info@omsf.io](mailto:info@omsf.io) 


We look forward to hearing from you!
