#### a. Hosted Project Member

By joining a Hosted Project of interest, you become the Hosted Project and OMSF member. Any funds received in this way are spent following decisions made by the governing body of the Hosted Project, under the OMSF oversight. Benefits for Hosted Project Members will be specified in the agreement between the Hosted Project and the OMSF. As a Hosted Project Member, you can vote for candidates to sit on the OMSF Board of Directors.


#### b. Supporting Member

You can become a Supporting Member by donating directly to the OMSF at least $100,000 USD. These funds are spent at discretion of the OMSF Board of Directors. For example, the OMSF may create new programs and projects, organize events, hire additional support staff, distribute funds among Hosted Projects, etc. Supporting Members may nominate and vote for candidates to sit on the OMSF Board of Directors.
